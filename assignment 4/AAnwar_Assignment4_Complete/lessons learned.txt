This assignment was relativley easy. I understood every part of this project and it made sense to me why everything worked the way it should have. The only method 
that wasn't working right away was my get method. I originally was just checking the index and not using the for loop at all, but then I iterated through every element
in the linked list and that solved it. Another thing I was struggling with was getting a NullPointerException. I fixed this pretty soon because I realized that in my add
method, I was assuming that the linked list was already created. To fix this I created a for loop in the constructor for every index in the ArrayList I would instantiate
a linked list and this solved the issue.
